Gathers msinfo32 files from users with extremely low fps only in ancient and uploads it to a server

Ancient has caused major issues for CSGO players even with really good PCs.This utility will gather the PC info and upload it to my server.

The files will be sent to the devs as a pack so that they have easier time gathering PC data.

My free FTP server will be alive for 3 days for file gathering. If anyone knows a good and cheap FTP server services,please DM me on twitter.

The source code will be released,but the server credentials will be wipped out from this repo for obvious reasons.

If the util wont respond,or has issues,the free upload space has been filled or the trial has run out.I will update the source code when i get a new ftp server.
